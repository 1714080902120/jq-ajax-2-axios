# JQ-Ajax-2-Axios README

as the name meaning, it can transform your `$.ajax({})` block into `try catch + axios` block;

## how to use

**before transform, you must select the block which you want to transform**

1. key down F1 and input `transform`, select the one connect to this plugin;
2. shortcut `ctrl + shift + q` in `windows` while `cmd + shift + q` in `Mac`;
3. (recommend), use editor `menus`, and find the command.

## config

**jq_ajax_2_axios.config**
- `axios_path`: your axios path, cause it is hard to know your axios path.
- `reg_str`: an nest array which elements contains an `reg rule` and replace `target`, make sure your regexp is correct.
- `axios_alias`: your axios's name, you can all rename: `this.$axios` which meaning use your global axios from instance.


- example:
open your user settings.json, and copy it into the json
```json
      "jq_ajax_2_axios.config": {
        "axios_path": "import { axios } from '@/apis/request'",
        "reg_str": [[".*?\\$.parseJSON(.*?);", ""]],
        "axios_alias": "this.$axios"
    }
```

## note
1. note that if you have both fail() and error()ï¼Œand this two function has params, you need to handly transform some code where use the params cause the fail() and error() function are transform together into the catch block.
