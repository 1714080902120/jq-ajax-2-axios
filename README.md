# JQ-Ajax-2-Axios README

as the name meaning, it can transform your `$.ajax({})` block into `try catch + axios` block;

## how to use

**before transform, you must select the block which you want to transform**

1. key down F1 and input `transform`, select the one connect to this plugin;
2. shortcut `ctrl + shift + q` in `windows` while `cmd + shift + q` in `Mac`;
3. (recommend), use editor `menus`, and find the command.

## note
1. cause it is hard to know where your axios's path, so you have to import your axios before transform.
2. note that if you have both fail() and error()ï¼Œand this two function has params, you need to handly transform some code where use the params cause the fail() and error() function are transform together into the catch block.
